# Circuit Breaker Simulator

Why should you use a circuit breaker in your code?
This repository holds a very simple simulator which can illustrate why.

Download the repo and then open the `index.html` file to run the simulator.

### Disclaimer
Note that this repository is **not** meant to contain a general-use circuit breaker.
In fact, I'm sure it's a pretty poor implementation.
It just exists to show off the ideas of circuit breakers.

So don't just use this in your production code!
